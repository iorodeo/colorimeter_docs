Optional TuxCase kit
========================
The optional colorimeter TuxCASE kit can be used as a protective enclosure for the Arduino, protecting the electronics boards from liquid spills in the lab when using the colorimeter. The aluminum enclosure is the same as the `TuxCASE for Arduino <http://www.iorodeo.com/content/tuxcase-arduino>`_. The main difference is the top - the clear acrylic top has been modified to include a cutout for the header on the colorimeter shield. A black acrylic spacer is included to raise the height of the clear top. TuxCASE is designed and manufactured by Tux-Lab. For additional information on the TuxCASE manufacturing procedure and supporting documentation, visit the `Tux-Lab project page <http://tux-lab.com/product_detail?id=1>`_.
